# Efiankey-Solution-Test

A Single Webpage where the user can interact with chatbot named Jamie
  
There is no any AI element involved in this chatbot.  
Only a few preset replies from chatbot based on the given message.
  
Note:  
To let the Jamie know what he should reply to us when we send him something.  
Use:  
“?” – to let the Jamie know that we are asking question.  
“!” – to let the Jamie know that we are yelling at him  
“!” + “?” – use both in a sentence as yelling a question at him  
“Jamie” – as calling his name  
  
Anything answers other than mentioned above are considered something he don’t understand.
